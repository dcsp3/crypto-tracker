Crypto Tracker is a web app that tracks my crypto portfolio using the Coinbase API.

Future plans of this application are:
- Including other investments I make as I continue to diversify my portfolio thus making an all-in-one investment tracker.
- Switching to another web framework since using Django doesn't make any sense as we're not working with databases.


# Features

- Portfolio Value- The first section of the application includes the total portfolio value and a breakdown of all currencies and their respective values.
- Portfolio Allocation- This section features a doughnut chart (using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)) to display the allocation of different currencies in % value.
- Profit Margin- Features a horizontal bar chart (again, using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)) to display profit (or loss) margins for each individual currency. It also has a section to display the total return on investment (ROI%) and Total Profit/Loss in Â£.
- Table- The last section of the page contains a table that tracks various metrics of each individual currency.
